      <section>
        <p> I’m a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley and a Research Associate at the <a href="https://cpd.berkeley.edu/">Center on the Politics of Development</a>. My research sits at the intersection of the political economy of development, gender and politics, and environmental and climate politics, with a regional focus on India.  
        </p>
		<p> ​Much of my work focuses on understanding the persistence of male elite power. This includes research that investigates male elite “capture” of local democracy and the limitations of institutional solutions to democratize power. My current research program focuses on how agricultural transformations, natural resource politics, and climate change have shaped patriarchy in historical and contemporary perspective. A related line of work investigates the broader politics of gender and climate change. I employ a variety of methods in my research: survey and field experiments, qualitative fieldwork and ethnography, observational causal inference, natural language processing, and the use of geospatial and weather data.
        </p>
		<p> My work has appeared or is forthcoming in the <i>American Political Science Review</i>, <i>The Journal of Politics</i>, and <i>World Development</i>. My research has been funded by the Empirical Study of Gender Research Network, the Center for Effective Global Action, the National Science Foundation, the Fulbright Association, the Global Democracy Commons, the Institute of International Studies, and the Weiss Fund for Research in Development Economics.
