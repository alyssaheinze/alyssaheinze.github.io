I'm a PhD student in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley and a Research Associate at the [Center on the Politics of Development](https://cpd.berkeley.edu/). My research interests include _gendered_ understandings of: the political economy of local development, political inequality, and the socio-political consequences of climate change. In my research, I use a mix of qualitative, (natural) experimental, and machine-learning techniques, often with the goal of making causal inferences. I conduct research in India and Côte d'Ivoire.

Prior to Berkeley, I was a Fulbright-Nehru Research Fellow and Lombard Fellow affiliated with the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics in Pune, India. I also worked for the Women’s Economic Empowerment Unit at the U.S. Department of State in Washington, D.C., Vera Solutions in Mumbai, India, and Chhori (Daughter) in Kathmandu, Nepal. I hold an MSc in Economics from Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne and a BA in Political Science and South Asian Studies from Dartmouth College.
