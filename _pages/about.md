I'm a PhD student in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley and a Research Associate at the [Center on the Politics of Development](https://cpd.berkeley.edu/). I research _gendered_ understandings of: the political economy of local development, political inequality, and the socio-political consequences of climate change. Methodologically, I employ qualitative, experimental, and machine-learning methods. I am also driven by and committed to cumulative learning in the social sciences, recyling of existing data, and the minimization of carbon emissions in conducting research. I conduct research in India and Côte d'Ivoire.

Outside of the PhD, I have been a Fulbright-Nehru Research Fellow and Lombard Fellow affiliated with the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics in Pune, India. I have worked for the Research, Evaluation and Data Team at IDinsight, the Women’s Economic Empowerment Unit at the U.S. Department of State in Washington, D.C., Vera Solutions in Mumbai, India, and Chhori (Daughter) in Kathmandu, Nepal. I hold an MSc in Economics from Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne and a BA in Political Science and South Asian Studies from Dartmouth College.
