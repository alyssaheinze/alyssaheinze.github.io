I'm a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley and a Research Associate at the [Center on the Politics of Development](https://cpd.berkeley.edu/). My research interests include gender, political inequality, development and the environment. Current collaborative projects map barriers to women representatives' power and test solutions to mitigate these barriers, in rural India.

Prior to Berkeley, I was a Fulbright-Nehru Research Fellow and Lombard Fellow affiliated with the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics in Pune, India. I also worked for the Women’s Economic Empowerment Unit at the U.S. Department of State in Washington, D.C., Vera Solutions in Mumbai, India, and Chhori (Daughter) in Kathmandu, Nepal. I hold an MSc in Economics from Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne and a BA in Political Science and South Asian Studies from Dartmouth College.
